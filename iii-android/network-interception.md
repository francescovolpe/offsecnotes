# Network Interception

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Introduction</mark>

In android there are several ways to make HTTP requests. For example using `HttpURLConnection` (low-level API built into Java), `OkHttp` (A popular third-party library) etc.

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Cleartext Traffic</mark>

By default, Android strives to prevent developers from unintentionally sending cleartext HTTP traffic. However, if developers explicitly set `usesCleartextTraffic=true` in the manifest or network security configuration, cleartext traffic is permitted.

## <mark style="color:yellow;">SSL interception</mark>

To intercept TLS/SSL traffic, the proxy certificate must be trusted by the device. Android recognizes two types of certificates: **user** certificates and **system** certificates. Applications can explicitly configure which certificate types they trust using **network security config**.

Example `network_security_config.xml`:

```xml
<base-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="false">
    <trust-anchors>
        <certificates src="system" />
        <certificates src="user" />
    </trust-anchors>
</base-config>
```

<details>

<summary>Default configuration</summary>

Android 9 (API level 28) and higher

```xml
<base-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="false">
    <trust-anchors>
        <certificates src="system" />
    </trust-anchors>
</base-config>
```

Android 7.0 (API level 24) to Android 8.1 (API level 27)

```xml
<base-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="true">
    <trust-anchors>
        <certificates src="system" />
    </trust-anchors>
</base-config>
```

Android 6.0 (API level 23) and lower

```xml
<base-config cleartextTrafficPermitted="true">
    <trust-anchors>
        <certificates src="system" />
        <certificates src="user" />
    </trust-anchors>
</base-config>
```

If the application doesn't accept user certificates you need to install system certificate (or patching network security config).

### <mark style="color:yellow;">User Certificate</mark>

Install it in the user CA store via Android settings. In general apps trust user certificates if it targets Android 6 (API 23) or lower, or network security config allows it.

<details>

<summary>Install user certificate guide</summary>

1. Download the certificate from `http://<burp_proxy_listener>`
2. Go on setting, search certificate and install by selected it

**Install on older Android ≤ 11**

Same as above but you need to run this command because it expected another file format.

```sh
openssl x509 -inform DER -in cacert.der -out cacert.pem
```

</details>

### <mark style="color:yellow;">System Certificate</mark>

**Requirement**: rooted device.

* Rooted physical device
* Rooted emulator
* With Android (AVD) using non-Google emulator  image

<details>

<summary>Install system certificate guide</summary>

1. Install the proxy certificate as a regular user certificate
2. `adb shell`
3. Run this script:

```sh
su

# Backup the existing system certificates to the user certs folder
cp /system/etc/security/cacerts/* /data/misc/user/0/cacerts-added/

# Create the in-memory mount on top of the system certs folder
mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /system/etc/security/cacerts

# copy all system certs and our user cert into the tmpfs system certs folder
cp /data/misc/user/0/cacerts-added/* /system/etc/security/cacerts/

# Fix any permissions & selinux context labels
chown root:root /system/etc/security/cacerts/*
chmod 644 /system/etc/security/cacerts/*
chcon u:object_r:system_file:s0 /system/etc/security/cacerts/*
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>Install system certificate on Android ≥ 14 guide</summary>

1. Install the proxy certificate as a regular user certificate
2. `adb shell`
3. Run this script by Tim Perry from [HTTP Toolkit](https://httptoolkit.com/blog/android-14-install-system-ca-certificate/)

```sh
# Create a separate temp directory, to hold the current certificates
# Otherwise, when we add the mount we can't read the current certs anymore.
mkdir -p -m 700 /data/local/tmp/tmp-ca-copy

# Copy out the existing certificates
cp /apex/com.android.conscrypt/cacerts/* /data/local/tmp/tmp-ca-copy/

# Create the in-memory mount on top of the system certs folder
mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /system/etc/security/cacerts

# Copy the existing certs back into the tmpfs, so we keep trusting them
mv /data/local/tmp/tmp-ca-copy/* /system/etc/security/cacerts/

# Copy our new cert in, so we trust that too
cp /data/misc/user/0/cacerts-added/* /system/etc/security/cacerts/

# Update the perms & selinux context labels
chown root:root /system/etc/security/cacerts/*
chmod 644 /system/etc/security/cacerts/*
chcon u:object_r:system_file:s0 /system/etc/security/cacerts/*

# Deal with the APEX overrides, which need injecting into each namespace:

# First we get the Zygote process(es), which launch each app
ZYGOTE_PID=$(pidof zygote || true)
ZYGOTE64_PID=$(pidof zygote64 || true)
# N.b. some devices appear to have both!

# Apps inherit the Zygote's mounts at startup, so we inject here to ensure
# all newly started apps will see these certs straight away:
for Z_PID in "$ZYGOTE_PID" "$ZYGOTE64_PID"; do
    if [ -n "$Z_PID" ]; then
        nsenter --mount=/proc/$Z_PID/ns/mnt -- \
            /bin/mount --bind /system/etc/security/cacerts /apex/com.android.conscrypt/cacerts
    fi
done

# Then we inject the mount into all already running apps, so they
# too see these CA certs immediately:

# Get the PID of every process whose parent is one of the Zygotes:
APP_PIDS=$(
    echo "$ZYGOTE_PID $ZYGOTE64_PID" | \
    xargs -n1 ps -o 'PID' -P | \
    grep -v PID
)

# Inject into the mount namespace of each of those apps:
for PID in $APP_PIDS; do
    nsenter --mount=/proc/$PID/ns/mnt -- \
        /bin/mount --bind /system/etc/security/cacerts /apex/com.android.conscrypt/cacerts &
done
wait # Launched in parallel - wait for completion here

echo "System certificate injected"
```

</details>

### <mark style="color:yellow;">Patching Network Security Config</mark>

1. Unpack the apk

```sh
apktool d target.apk
```

2. Modify the `AndroidManifest.xml` to add a `networkSecurityConfig` (`xml/network_security_config.xml`). If it's already present edit the file.

```xml
<!-- Example -->
<network-security-config>
    <base-config>
        <trust-anchors>
            <certificates src="system" />
            <certificates src="user" />
        </trust-anchors>
    </base-config>
</network-security-config>
```

3. Repack & sign the apk

```sh
# Repack
apktool b
# Sign
java -jar uber-apk-signer.jar -apk <app_name>.apk
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: unpacking and repacking an app can break stuff.

## <mark style="color:yellow;">Intercepting Without Proxy Support</mark>

If you configure an HTTP proxy in Android settings, you can intercept network traffic. However,&#x20;

* Connections made directly via `TCP sockets` bypass the proxy and cannot be intercepted.
* Applications may bypass the HTTP proxy settings if the developer configures them to disallow proxy usage. E.g. with **OkHttp**:

```java
OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient.Builder()
    .proxy(java.net.Proxy.NO_PROXY) // Disables proxy usage
    .build();
```

* Also framework like **Flutter** and **Xamarin** application does not respect system proxy.

### <mark style="color:yellow;">HTTP Interception with VPN</mark>

**Requirement**: the proxy certificate must be installed in the system certificate store.

If the proxy settings are ignored, use an Android VPN service app to intercept app traffic. You can use the open-source RethinkDNS app [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.celzero.bravedns](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.celzero.bravedns).

Steps:

1. Set DNS settings to "System DNS"
2. Add an HTTP(S) CONNECT proxy
3. Start the VPN service

### <mark style="color:yellow;">DNS Spoofing & Transparent Proxy</mark>

**Requirement**: The proxy certificate must be installed in the system certificate store.

Before starting, you need to bind Burp to a privileged port.

<details>

<summary>Binding Burp to a privileged port (with authbind)</summary>

```sh
sudo touch /etc/authbind/byport/443
sudo chown $USER:$USER /etc/authbind/byport/443
sudo chmod 755 /etc/authbind/byport/443

authbind --deep java -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -jar burpsuite.jar
```

</details>

1. We need some kind of DNS server where we can control the IP. Example `dnsmasq.conf`:

```
address=/target.com/192.168.1.50
log-queries
```

2. Run `dnsmasq` with docker:

```sh
docker pull andyshinn/dnsmasq
docker run --name my-dnsmasq --rm -it -p 0.0.0.0:53:53/udp -v /tmp/dnsmasq.conf:/etc/dnsmasq.conf andyshinn/dnsmasq
```

3. Enforce DNS usage using Android's VPN feature with tools like RethinkDNS.

* From "configure" -> "DNS" -> Change DNS settings to "Other DNS"&#x20;
* Select "DNS Proxy"&#x20;
* Create a new entry pointing at your local DNS server host

4. Finally, configure your proxy tool for invisible proxying. Burp will act as an HTTP(S) server, parse the `HOST` header, and forward requests. Ensure an invisible proxy listener is set on ports 443 and 80.

<details>

<summary>Invisible proxying</summary>

**Normal Proxy**\
In a normal proxy, the client (e.g., a browser or app) is explicitly configured to use the proxy. This means the client intentionally routes traffic through the proxy. Thus:

* The client is aware of the existence of the proxy.
* HTTPS requires the client to accept the certificate generated by the proxy (MITM).
* The request contains both the relative path (/path) and the full address (e.g. `GET http://www.example.com/path HTTP/1.1`)

**Invisible Proxy**\
An invisible proxy operates without the client being explicitly configured to use it. This is useful when the client does not support proxy configurations. Therefore, the client remains unaware of the proxy. However:

With plain HTTP, a proxy-style request looks like this:

```http
GET http://example.org/foo.php HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
```

A non-proxy-style request looks like this:

```http
GET /foo.php HTTP/1.1
Host: example.org
```

Proxies usually use the full URL in the first line to determine the destination, ignoring the `Host` header. In invisible proxying, Burp parses the `Host` header from non-proxy-style requests to determine the destination.
