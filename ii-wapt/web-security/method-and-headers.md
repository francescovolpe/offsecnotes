# Method & Headers

## TRACE Method

The web server responds to TRACE method requests by echoing the received request.

**Security implication**

This can reveal sensitive information, like internal authentication headers added by reverse proxies, such as an authorization header.



## X-Forwarded-For

<details>

<summary>Theory</summary>

* This is a de-facto standard header for identifying the originating IP address of a client connecting to a web server through a proxy server.

<!---->

* The header is an HTTP multi-valued header, which means that it can have one or more values, each separated by a comma.

<!---->

* This header is not added by default

<!---->

* `X-Forwarded-For: 2001:DB8::6, 192.0.2.1` Let us consider an incoming TCP connection from 127.0.0.1. This implies that the client had IPv6 address 2001:DB8::6 when connecting to the first proxy, then that proxy used IPv4 to connect from 192.0.2.1 to the final proxy, which was running on localhost.

</details>

* `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']` contains actual physical IP address that the web server received the connection from and that the response will be sent to.
* `$_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR']` this value is easily spoofed.&#x20;

**Security implication**

* Use it to check some reflected parameter that contains your IP
* Use it to bypass controls that are placed on your IP (ex. rate limit)



## X-Forwarded-Host

The `X-Forwarded-Host` (XFH) header is a de-facto standard header for identifying the original host requested by the client in the `Host` HTTP request header.

**Security implication**

Test this header when you need to verify a link generated by the application. For example, a password reset email might contain a link like `https://website.com/reset-password?token=<token>`. By modifying this header, you can control "website.com".



## X-Original-URL / X-Rewrite-URL

Some applications support non-standard headers such these in order to allow overriding the target URL in requests with the one specified in the header value.

**Security implication**

* This behavior can be used when access control is based on the request URL.

## Referrer-Policy

* The Referrer-Policy HTTP header controls how much referrer information (sent with the Referer header) should be included with requests.
* Aside from the HTTP header, you can set this policy in HTML.

**Security implication**

* Bypass validation CSRF attack when an application use referer header to defende against CSRF attacks
